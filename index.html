      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring web programmer, who is very excited to start their upcoming 6 month coding program. I have a cat named Moose, and I'm a very outgoing introvert.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in the small town of Jordan, MN; it's south of Shakopee (Valley Fair).</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to try new baking/cooking recipes, read fantasy genre books, play video games, and travel internationally.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that has work-from home capability, where I can live comfortably and only be working part time, so I can actually enjoy life outside of my job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>East side of St. Paul, MN in a house with three roommates and 2 cats.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Growing up, jobs in tech were never really presented as an accessible or realistic option for me, as a woman. Realizing as an adult that there were plenty of women in tech (still not enough though), I decided to further my education and make a career change. I love the idea of working in programming specifically, because you are creating something that others will use frequently; it involves problem solving, high attention to detail, and languages. Additionally, the programming world has so many opportunities that I find safety and security in turning it into a career. </p>
